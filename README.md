# Cat-vs.-Asteroids
Cat vs. Asteroids is a small QT & OpenGL game, made for the course Computer Graphics.

# How to play?
Simply open the project in QT and run! If you experience any problem, please open an issue in this repository.

To play, avoid the asteroids by going left/right (or A/D), or jumping over them using the spacebar. Over time, the score will increase. If you hit an asteroid, it's game over, but you can restart by pressing space.
